Writeup 1 due Wed Feb 17 by 11:59pm, saved as PDF in dropbox.

Your writeup needs to cover the following topics. Your entire team needs to be in agreement about the scope and technology before you submit this document:

    - A comprehensive overview of the project, how it will function, how users will interact, etc
        - The game will be played in a web browser and properly utilized in the dome of the planetarium.
    - What technology will be required (what do you need to make it, what do you need to show it)
        - Hosted on the Web.
        - Powered by p5.js
    - Where will the piece be installed/demo'ed? As you decide this keep in mind that not every team will be able to use a projector, 
    and not all projects will fit in the student gallery. If you're making a web app or native app, how would you like it displayed. 
        - It will be demoed in the planetarium and/or in the student gallery on a normal monitor.
    - Team member names, and roles. How will the work be divided, who will be the team leader... you need a team leader
        - Steven Gantz: Developer, 50% Development work, 33% team leader
        - Ryan Harrington: Developer, 50% Development work, 33% team leader
        - Juss DiSciullo: Creative Lead, 100% Creative control, 33% team leader
    - You need to create a name for your project, and sketch 5 concepts for logos (rough, they do not need to be finalized yet)
        - 
    - Personas, you'll need to create 5 personas for fictional users of your app/tool/installation. The goal of a persona is
    to put yourself in a typical user's shoes and figure out how/why they would use your project. 
    An overview: http://www.romanpichler.com/blog/persona-template-for-agile-product-management/
        - Guy/Girl at work killing time
        - Student trying to keep themselves occupied during class
        - Planetarium Director testing the projector
        - Anyone had home looking to play a game
        - Web game enthusiasts
        - Processing/p5 students
    - Competative analysis. Find at 10 competing projects (either similar concepts, similar technologies, 
    inspiration, etc). Include a screen shot a few sentence descriptions for each. List what's good 
    (what inspires you) and what you can improve on.
        - 
    - Mood board. This should include at least 15 images (and links for where you got the images) for
    visual concepts that will inspire your design in the next phase. If you're making an app, this should 
    be images of interfaces that are relevant to your design, if you're making an installation this is 
    images of projection/environments, etc. The images do not need to be on the same topic as your 
    project, they are just inspiration.
    - A rough wireframe/schematic of either the interface or environment for presentation of the project
